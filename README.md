I'm hoping that you have Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed. If not, have it installed.

1.  Open VSCode
2.  Go to File at the top then Open Folder
3.  Navigate to the project folder and click open.

**** Now your project is open in VSCode ****

4.  On the Left Sidebar on VSCode Click on Extensions (or press CTRL+SHIFT+X)
5. At the Top of the sidebar that slides in search "Live Server".
6. Click on the LiveServer option that comes after searching and then click on install.
7. Once it has completed close up you VSCode and reopen it.
8. Open your project folder as indicated in step 2 and 3. Give it a minute to setup.
9. At the bottom navigation bar (blue in color) of your VSCode  click on Go Live
10. Chrome will open up and your project will be loaded automatically.

**** congratulations You are done ****
